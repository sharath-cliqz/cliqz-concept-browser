#  Cliqz Concept Browser

This is a showcase experimental base for [Cliqz](https://cliqz.com/) technologies in a
browser. _This is not a production ready product!_

This project is based on Mozilla's [Reference Browser](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/reference-browser/)
project, with extra Cliqz technologies integrated, namely:
 * Quick search,
 * Cliqz prototype search engine results page,
 * Anti-tracking, adblocker and other privacy tools.

# Nightly Builds Directly
